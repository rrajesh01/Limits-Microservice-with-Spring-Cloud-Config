# Limits-Microservice-with-Spring-Cloud-Config
Created a Spring Boot microservice (`limits-service`) that retrieves configuration from a centralized Spring Cloud Config Server. Used `@ConfigurationProperties` to load dynamic values and exposed them via REST API. Set up the config server with native file system backend for property management.
